I'd learnt to use HTML and CSS in this project.
But in this particular project, I shifted my focus to using Bootstrap 5.0 effectively.

The pain points in this project are as follows:
- Bootstrap's very awkward naming system for classes made my HTML code look very clunky.
- Learning how to make a website responsive my using col-lg/md/sm etc was what took me the most time to figure out. 

The way I'd learnt to use bootstrap was to keep checking the bootstrap documentation. This was the main source for the answers to all my doubts.
